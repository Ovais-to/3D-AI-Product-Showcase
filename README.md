# 3D Product Showcase with AI Integration

Welcome to the repository for our cutting-edge 3D product showcase platform. This project demonstrates how to build a web-based 3D product visualization using ThreeJS, integrated with the dynamic capabilities of artificial intelligence.

## About The Project

In the modern digital marketplace, 3D visualization is not just a novelty but a necessity. This project embodies the forefront of web technology, combining 3D graphics with AI to provide an unparalleled user experience. This repository holds the code and resources used in the tutorial that guides you through the process of creating a fully-featured 3D product showcase.

### Built With

- **ThreeJS**: For rendering interactive 3D models in the browser.
- **React Three Fiber**: To integrate ThreeJS within the React ecosystem.
- **TailwindCSS**: For a utility-first approach to styling.
- **Framer Motion**: To add smooth and powerful animations.

### What You Will Learn

- Creating and manipulating 3D models and geometries with ThreeJS.
- Understanding and implementing lighting, camera, and spatial positioning in a 3D environment.
- Utilizing React Three Fiber for integrating 3D scenes into React applications.
- Designing responsive and animated web interfaces using TailwindCSS and Framer Motion.
- Employing Higher Order Components (HOCs) for writing reusable and maintainable code.
- Implementing custom color and file input to personalize 3D models.
- Leveraging DALLE AI for generating images and textures.
- Ensuring the application is responsive and performs well across all devices.
